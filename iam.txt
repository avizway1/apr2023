Login to AWS Account --> Top right cornor "Click on account name", "Security credentials"
--> Go to MFA and Activate MFA. Choose Virtual MFA..

root user : Unrestricted access on our AWS account.

==> Least privilages mechanism : provide permissions they really required to perform their job. Dont provide any addl services access.

S3 : Storage : username and pwd : IAM
ec2 : servers : username and pwd : IAM
support/monitor : username and pwd : IAM


IAM : Identity and Access management : Create Users, Groups and manage access to our aws accounts.


S3 : Simple Storage Service : Storage Service in AWS
EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud : Place where we can launch Servers
RDS : Relational Database Service : Database service in AWS (mssql/mysql/oracle).. 
VPC : Virtual private Cloud : Networking service in AWS.


IAM user : S3 Admin Access : iams3admin
IAM user : ec2 Admin Access : iamec2admin


Policy : Set of Permissions on our AWS environment.


Task : Enable MFA for your root user.

Task 1 : Create an IAM user, Provide him s3 full access, Login as this user and create a s3 bucket.
Try to access "ec2" and "rds". This should deny with errors.

Task 2 : Create an IAM user, Provide him "EC2 full access", Login as this user and verify ec2 dashboard.

Policy : Set of permissions on our AWS environment. 

1) AWS Managed policy (Based on Service)
2) AWS Managed - Job Function policy (Based on standard jobs in market - SystemAdmin/networkadmin/dba)
3) Customer managed policy (We can create based on our requirement)


Requirement : I need an IAM user, Who can access S3 and EC2, but not any other services.


Implicit Allow : You can access the services if you have any valid policy. Remaining all Deny automatically.

Requirement : I need an IAM user, Who can access any service but not s3.


Task 1 : Create an IAM user, Allow him to access S3 and ec2 services. Instead of AWS managed policies, create your own policy that allow access on s3 and ec2.

Task 2 : Create an IAM user, Provide him full access on AWS environment.  I want to DENY S3 Service for this user.  Login and try to access s3, it should deny.

Task 3 : Create an IAM, provide him "S3fullaccess" Login as this user and verify access on s3.
Try to Enable "MFA" for this user. 
Create a CustomPolicy to enable MFA and allocate this policy to the "Task 3" user and verify him access on MFA option.

Inline : Not a reusable policy. We can apply policy for specific resource.
You can add up to 6,144 characters per managed policy.
Use inline policies instead of managed policies
You can use as many inline policies as you want, but the aggregate policy size can't exceed the character quotas. 

The maximum limit for attaching a managed policy to an IAM role or user is 20.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length


CLoudTrail : Logging service in AWS. It logs everything (including refresh also).
--> Enabled by default. We dont have option disable it. 
--> Defaultly it can store last 90 days logs.


Permissions Boundary : AWS supports permissions boundaries for IAM entities (users or roles). A permissions boundary is an advanced feature for using a managed policy to set the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity. An entity's permissions boundary allows it to perform only the actions that are allowed by both its identity-based policies and its permissions boundaries.



Task 1 : Create an IAM user, Provide him "AdministratorAccess" policy. Now try to access "Billing Dashboard". It gives error. 
Fix this error and provide him billing access.

Task 2 : Create an IAM user, Privide him "S3FullACCESS", but i want to limit him to work only on "Mumbai region / ap-south-1".

Task 3 : Create an IAM user, Privide him "S3FullACCESS", but i want to limit him to work only from  specific network.
